# Ars et Scientia
Never understimate any knowledge. Frown upon people that see it as a dichotomy between theoretical and practical (keyboard monkeys). 
Need to understand the big picture.

Sense of nobility for your field and profession. Distinguish humans(know) versus other animals(do).


# What is Expertise/Mastery?
knowledge + experience

being able to answer all: what, how, why, 

Don't look at it like 1 element at a time /// look at it as a whole.

# How to?
A KEYBOARD MONKEY do stuff by imitation but dont understand the underlying. (copy-paste from Google)

You can get the knowledge by yourself from books, videos, experimentation or with help from an education profesionnal like university or online courses. 

- Each question is an opportunity: RTFM (man for binaries, rfc for protocols, documentation for software) and figure it out instead of copy-paste from Google. On the short term it is less efficient because it will take more time to get the answer but it is a garantee to mastery;
