# Introduction

## Keyboard Monkey vs Mastery

## Complete Process rather than individual components

Which cert. is better than the other? Practice or Theory .... I'd say **stop whining**, stop trying to do the minimum. Do them all, practical and theoretical certifications. There are no real ''junk'', they all have different viewpoints to bring.

Be complete and do not let an avenue untouched (business process for example or place of your cybersecurity job in the enterprise).

For example: pentester is **Quality Assurance** Specialized in security for architects, developpers, sysadmins, database administrators, etc. It may be overglorified and romanticized, but for the business ... it's what it does. And it does it after 17 others security controls that already block 90-99% of possible vulnerabilities.

You should know sysadmin if you pentest systems/networks and you should know development if you pentest web applications.
