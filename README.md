# Ars et Scientia
Never understimate any knowledge. Frown upon people that see it as a dichotomy between theoretical and practical (keyboard monkeys). The reality is that it is both and you need to understand the big picture as much as the details.

Sense of nobility for your field and profession. Distinguish humans(know) versus other animals(do).


# What is Expertise/Mastery?
knowledge + experience

being able to answer all: what, how, why, 

Don't look at it like 1 element at a time /// look at it as a whole.

# How to?
a KEYBOARD MONKEY do stuff by imitation but dont understand the underlying. (copy-paste from Google)

You can get the knowledge by yourself from books, videos, experimentation or with help from an education profesionnal like university or online courses. 

- Each question is an opportunity: RTFM (man for binaries, rfc for protocols, documentation for software) and figure it out instead of copy-paste from Google. On the short term it is less efficient because it will take more time to get the answer but it is a garantee to mastery;
