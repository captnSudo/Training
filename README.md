# Ars et Scientia
Never understimate any knowledge. Frown upon people that see it as a dichotomy between theoretical and practical (keyboard monkeys). 
Need to understand the big picture.

Sense of nobility for your field and profession. Distinguish humans(know) versus other animals(do).


# What is Expertise/Mastery?
knowledge + experience

being able to answer all: what, how, why,
