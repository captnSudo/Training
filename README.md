## Keyboard Monkey vs Mastery

It is false that only practical training count.

## Complete Process rather than individual components

Don't look at it one by one, individually. Look at the sum of whats learned and you'll see strengths/weakness in each one.

Which cert. is better than the other? Practice or Theory .... I'd say **stop whining**, stop trying to do the minimum. Do them all, practical and theoretical certifications. There are no real ''junk'', they all bring different viewpoints.

For example: pentester is **Quality Assurance** specialized in security for architects, developpers, sysadmins, database administrators, etc. It may be overglorified and romanticized, but for the business ... it's what it does. And it does it after 17 others security controls that already block 90-99% of possible vulnerabilities.

It is better to know sysadmin if you pentest systems/networks and development if you pentest web applications.
