For example: pentester is **Quality Assurance** Specialized in security for architects, developpers, sysadmins, database administrators, etc. It may be overglorified and romanticized, but for the business ... it's what it does. And it does it after 17 others security controls that already block 90-99% of possible vulnerabilities.
